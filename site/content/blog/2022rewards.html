        <h1>Some Stuff I Liked Last Year!</h1>
        <p style="font-size: 10pt;"> January 9, 2023</p>
        <p>It's the end of the year! So that means I can look back on all the media I consumed this year and give a
            shoutout to anything I liked. It's not for things that came out this year, just things that I consumed this
            year. Did I get this done late and it's January already? Yes!

        <p>I originally subscribed to Dropout because I wanted to watch Game Changer and their new Make Some Noise, but
            oh boy there is so much content
            coming from there it has changed the way I consume internet content. Turns out the combination of internet
            humor and gameshows is exactly up my alley.
            And it's fun looking through the backlog and seeing some old CollegeHumor stuff that I must have seen 10
            years ago. And who knew, Dimension 20 is <em>really good.</em> And I really see the value in having
            everything release on a schedule
            one week at a time, the drip feed of content really does make things better. And it's always fun to remember
            that this Tuesday is a new Dirty Laundry,
            or that tomorrow there's a new Play It By Ear. Having a set amount of content being released on a consistent
            basis has been great and its helped me move
            away from mindlessly watching Youtube or browsing Reddit all the time.
        </p>
        <p>
            There's so much I haven't even touched yet, but here's what I watched and enjoyed
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Dirty Laundry</strong> - If you've watched Would I Lie to You? (or any of its clips) its like
                that but not as
                British. And the cocktail tutorials are fascinating to watch as someone with no interest in them.</li>
            <li><strong>Game Changer (and Make Some Noise)</strong> - I don't even know what I can say about this show
                that hasn't already been said. It's great. And the 5th
                season that's currently coming out is already great and its not even finished yet.</li>
            <li><strong>Dimension 20: A Court of Fey and Flowers</strong> - I wasn't planning on jumping into Dimension
                20 because watching 2 hour episodes every week felt like crazy talk.
                But then I got covid and thought "well I got nothing else to do let's watch the new D20 season" and boy
                howdy. I wasn't one for regency dramas, or so I thought, but turns out you can hide it under a veneer of
                DnD and I will be right into it. I don't remember the last time I was this invested in a cast of
                characters. Everyone does amazing and I could go on all day without properly describing how I like it so
                much. You gotta try this one out, at least finish the second episode before you think its not for you.
                And all the <em>fanart?</em> amazing.
            </li>

        <p>I hadn't had a gaming podcast in my rotation for a couple of years until about last year when <em>The
                Besties</em> came back, and from that return I heard Triple Click's Kirk Hamilton guest for one episode
            and decided to give it a shot. It's a great gamer (lowercase g) podcast with a good mix of actual discussion
            about video games and lighthearted humor. You never know what you'll get each week, whether it be a review
            of a game, a weekly news roundup, or a deep dive into some general aspect of video games. Shoutouts to
            Kirk's ECOTAG system for categorizing open world games, that was the episode I started listening and it was
            a great into to the podcast and a great system, I think about it every time I look at an open world game.
            Maybe I haven't been keeping up with games as much but I feel like I learn something new from them every
            week. It's definitely my best podcast find of the year.

        <p>Combining subscription-based entertainment and podcasts from the two above posts, all the content I get for
            ~$7CAD a month from Dungeons and Daddies (not a bdsm podcast) has been well worth my dollars. Teen Talk is a
            great episode meta-discussion that provides behind the scenes of a dnd podcast and also having "two dudes
            talking" energy but in a good way. And the Sons and Sonsability miniseries was also some of the funniest
            audio content I have listened to this year. (Good year for regency-era dnd content). Plus its great to not
            have ads, its not something I realized would be nice until I had it.</p>

        <p>Some comment on the video that I can no longer find put it pretty succintly as (paraphrasing) "distilling
            thoughts I had had on the topic for a while into an understanable work" which is exactly how I would
            describe this video essay. Before I just had a cloud of ideas floating in my head but this video helped cool
            it down, condense onto a surface, and become collected into a bottle in the form of a liquid. I've always
            been wary of internet hate mobs for media and this video has been a good way to express how I feel about it.
            I want to show this video to everyone, hence why its here. </p>

            I have complicated feelings about this game because it took me a good 8 months to complete, but sometimes
            the longer something takes the better the payoff. That usually isn't true don't fall for the sunk cost
            fallacy, cut your losses while you can. Anyway, finishing this game was probably one of my best video game
            experiences just for all the emotions I felt. While playing I was thinking "I hate this I hate this I'm so
            confused" but looking back, I'm thinking "damn that was a really good game and I wish I could experience
            that all again." It's a beautiful, confusing game. Last thing, DO NOT LOOK ANYTHING UP ABOUT THIS GAME.
            Looking back I could have figured out everything I was stuck on. If you really get stuck, ask someone who
            finished the game for vague
            hints, so much of the joy of the game is learning yourself.

            Speaking of games that I took forever to complete, I started this one Summer 2020 and only finished it this
            Spring. It took me a bit to really get into the meat of it, but once it started clicking for me, it really
            clicked. One of the things that made me bounce off of the game was some of the super difficult random
            encounters that would wipe the team out of nowhere. But once I learned the art of same scumming, I was
            invincible. Being able to just avoid that encounter aside, it also allowed me to make a pseudo rewind system
            that allowed me to try out new mechanics and learn how to play the game. Once I got over the curve I really
            enjoyed all the strategy that comes into the combat and it really helped me enjoy the game. Might make me
            want to get into more turn based strategy games.
