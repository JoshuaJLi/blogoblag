        <h1>Some Stuff I Liked Last Year! (2023 Edition)</h1>
        <p class="date"> January 17, 2024</p>
        <p>Oh no it's another year passed already? Aw geez well there was still some pretty good stuff that I saw last
            year that I will give a recommendation to.
            Maybe next year I'll do this on time.

            Started the year off strong with what I'll say the best game development documentary I've seen. It's
            incredible that Double Fine just allowed their entire workplace to be documented for 7 years through the
            development of Psychonauts 2 on its own but the team at 2 Player Productions really put in that magic that
            makes each episode of the 32-part doc compelling to watch. There is nothing like it that exists anywhere on
            the internet and it is truely a feat that is mind-boggling to understand but epic to witness completed. </p>
        <p>
            The documentary is great at showing first and foremost that it is people that make games and that even
            though the process appears to be incredibly technical what's important is the humans behind it. I know it's
            dumb to
            say but watching this reminded me of watching <em>The Office</em> because this is what that they going for.
            Except instead of goofs and jokes it's heartfelt moments and witnessing the creative sausage get made up
            close. There was even times when I accidentally watched a later episode in the doc and everyone's hair was
            different and I thought "oh looks like there was a timeskip".
        </p>
        <p>
            The documentary also gave me a lot to think about regarding team dynamics and how to be a good leader which
            was something I had to think more about this
            year. Seeing the pitfalls that the team runs into and how serious problems don't get addressed because
            they're not obvious was really eye-opening and along with other lessons I think has really shaped how I
            think about leading.

        <p> Also shoutouts to <a
                href="https://orangedrink.bandcamp.com/album/double-fine-psychodyssey-original-soundtrack-vol-1">Orange
                Drink's incredible soundtrack</a> that really gives the doc auditory identity. I think I have been
            conditioned to think of it as the "work music" now. <a
                href="https://orangedrink.bandcamp.com/track/the-ascent">The Ascent</a> may be the most hype music for
            one of the most epic moments of the documentary.</p>
        <p>
            Anyone who's interested in video games, the creative process, management, or
            just seeing how an office works should watch this doc. I hope even with the Microsoft aquisition that Double
            Fine will be able to create more of these in the future. Even if you're intimidated by the length, as they
            say with eating a elephant, it's one bite at a time. Watch it while eating lunch or when taking a break
            instead of chugging down the Youtube algorithm.

        <p>I hadn't had a gaming podcast in my rotation for a couple of years until about last year when <em>The
                Besties</em> came back, and from that return I heard Triple Click's Kirk Hamilton guest for one episode
            and decided to give it a shot. It's a great gamer (lowercase g) podcast with a good mix of actual discussion
            about video games and lighthearted humor. You never know what you'll get each week, whether it be a review
            of a game, a weekly news roundup, or a deep dive into some general aspect of video games. Shoutouts to
            Kirk's ECOTAG system for categorizing open world games, that was the episode I started listening and it was
            a great into to the podcast and a great system, I think about it every time I look at an open world game.
            Maybe I haven't been keeping up with games as much but I feel like I learn something new from them every
            week. It's definitely my best podcast find of the year.

        <p>Combining subscription-based entertainment and podcasts from the two above posts, all the content I get for
            ~$7CAD a month from Dungeons and Daddies (not a bdsm podcast) has been well worth my dollars. Teen Talk is a
            great episode meta-discussion that provides behind the scenes of a dnd podcast and also having "two dudes
            talking" energy but in a good way. And the Sons and Sonsability miniseries was also some of the funniest
            audio content I have listened to this year. (Good year for regency-era dnd content). Plus its great to not
            have ads, its not something I realized would be nice until I had it.</p>

        <p>Some comment on the video that I can no longer find put it pretty succintly as (paraphrasing) "distilling
            thoughts I had had on the topic for a while into an understanable work" which is exactly how I would
            describe this video essay. Before I just had a cloud of ideas floating in my head but this video helped cool
            it down, condense onto a surface, and become collected into a bottle in the form of a liquid. I've always
            been wary of internet hate mobs for media and this video has been a good way to express how I feel about it.
            I want to show this video to everyone, hence why its here. </p>

            I have complicated feelings about this game because it took me a good 8 months to complete, but sometimes
            the longer something takes the better the payoff. That usually isn't true don't fall for the sunk cost
            fallacy, cut your losses while you can. Anyway, finishing this game was probably one of my best video game
            experiences just for all the emotions I felt. While playing I was thinking "I hate this I hate this I'm so
            confused" but looking back, I'm thinking "damn that was a really good game and I wish I could experience
            that all again." It's a beautiful, confusing game. Last thing, DO NOT LOOK ANYTHING UP ABOUT THIS GAME.
            Looking back I could have figured out everything I was stuck on. If you really get stuck, ask someone who
            finished the game for vague
            hints, so much of the joy of the game is learning yourself.

            Speaking of games that I took forever to complete, I started this one Summer 2020 and only finished it this
            Spring. It took me a bit to really get into the meat of it, but once it started clicking for me, it really
            clicked. One of the things that made me bounce off of the game was some of the super difficult random
            encounters that would wipe the team out of nowhere. But once I learned the art of same scumming, I was
            invincible. Being able to just avoid that encounter aside, it also allowed me to make a pseudo rewind system
            that allowed me to try out new mechanics and learn how to play the game. Once I got over the curve I really
            enjoyed all the strategy that comes into the combat and it really helped me enjoy the game. Might make me
            want to get into more turn based strategy games.
