    <h1>Development Log</h1>
    <h4>December 29th, 2022</h4>
    <p>Put in the effort today to actually try and make this whole thing work!
        I followed the <a href="https://www.dragonflycave.com/html-guide">Dragonfly Cave html tutorials</a> and got some
        major stuff working!
    <ul>
        <li>Got CSS set up sort of and the site has some padding, font, and a bit of colour, and already looks less jank
            than before</li>
        <li>Learned about containers and divs but did not actually tackle them because they look scary</li>
        <li>Set up the navigation top menu bar so now you can navigate to different pages</li>
        <li>Learned how to include html in other html so I don't need to copy and paste all the time. I learned how to
            do it with JavaScript from
            <a href="https://ikewise.neocities.org/includes.htm">this tutorial</a> but I am really unhappy with how it
            works.
            I just want to have html files that link into other html files. Java has spoiled me.
        </li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h4>November 30th, 2022</h4>
    <p>I hope I can make this website act as a log for my web development journey, while also not being under the stress
        of getting everything right.
        I don't even know how pagragraph formatting works this is just a big line right now</p>

    <p>Here's what I got done today</p>
    <u1>
        <li>Installed Ruby on my computer so I could get the <a href="https://neocities.org/cli">Neocities CLI</a>
            working
            so I can push my local changes to the website like a cool developer </li>
        <li>Uploaded the files to <a href="https://github.com/JoshuaJLi/blogoblag">Github</a> becuase that just feels
            like
            the right thing to do</li>
        <li>Followed this tutorial from <a href="https://bechnokid.neocities.org/blog/2022_08_22.html"> Bencho Kid's
                Hideout</a> on how to get a html preview in VS Code so now I feeel like I'm ready to roll </li>
    </u1>
