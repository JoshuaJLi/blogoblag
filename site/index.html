    <h3>Development Log</h3>
    <h4>November 30th, 2022</h4>
    <p>I hope I can make this website act as a log for my web development journey, while also not being under the stress of getting everything right. 
      I don't even know how pagragraph formatting works this is just a big line right now</p>

    <p>Here's what I got done today</p>
    <o1>
      <li>Installed Ruby on my computer so I could get the <a href="https://neocities.org/cli">Neocities CLI</a> working so I can push my local changes to the website like a cool developer </li>
      <li>Uploaded the files to <a href="https://github.com/JoshuaJLi/blogoblag">Github</a> becuase that just feels like the right thing to do</li>
      <li>Followed this tutorial <a href="https://bechnokid.neocities.org/blog/2022_08_22.html"> from Bencho Kid's Hideout</a> on how to get a html preview in VS Code so now I feeel like I'm ready to roll </li>
